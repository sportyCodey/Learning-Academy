Drew's Learning Academy.

This project is a JavaFX GUI application that is for children 7 - 10 years old. In one sentence this application can be described as software that helps children with their learning. Basically, there are 3 applications inside the software that are quizes and/or games for the user. Each application tests a different subject in school. 

The 3 applications are Vocabulary Builder to help with their vocabulary skills. The next application is Paragraph Finisher, which helps with their skills on determining the best way to finish a paragraph in regard to words. The 3rd application is called Math Bowl, and it's a quiz and/or game that challenges their addition and subtraction skills. 

Each user can have their own account in this software. The user creates a username and password. Their highscores for each application will be saved as well. All of this information is saved in a binary file.

The Beta version is released on 4/13/2018. This is the first time being released. This would be LearningAcademy1.0.
